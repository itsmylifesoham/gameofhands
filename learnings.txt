sometimes if it fails then remove android platform and install again.

sometimes have to do phonegap clean and then phonegap run android. this happened for the cordova-plugin-facebook4 .

Important: in facebookconnect.xml file inside cordova-plugin-facebook4 we need to add these keys manually to resources tag:
<string name="fb_app_id">123456789</string>
<string name="fb_app_name">TEST</string>

this shud have typically got added when we passed variables while running the plugin but does not take from config-xml.

see more details here : http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/facebook/

also if nothing works do to D:\MyData\startups\gameofhands\src\platforms\android\app\src\main\res\values and put facebookconnect.xml there with the two keys .
copy this file from plugin directory of cordova-plugin-facebook4

see this too : https://github.com/jeduan/cordova-plugin-facebook4/issues/599 for the fb_app_id and db_app_name not getting copied over. chris has a solution to do this without
modifying any platform files.

- if you want to change app id and app name uninstall and reinstall the plugin.

- when we run cordova-facebook4 plugin , the tag added inside fb-root is not proper, tht is it does not wait for the fb js sdk to load and goes on to load a nonexistent
fbsdk.js and puts it in dom. luckily the previously adding script tag for the online version of sdk loads and FB is set on the window object.
