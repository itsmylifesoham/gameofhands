sometimes if it fails then remove android platform and install again.

sometimes have to do phonegap clean and then phonegap run android. this happened for the cordova-plugin-facebook4 .

Important: in facebookconnect.xml file inside cordova-plugin-facebook4 we need to add these keys manually to resources tag:
<string name="fb_app_id">123456789</string>
<string name="fb_app_name">TEST</string>

this shud have typically got added when we passed variables while running the plugin but does not take from config-xml.
