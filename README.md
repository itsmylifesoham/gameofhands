# phonegapstartertemplate
Phonegap starter project with 1 basic plugin.

The Phonegap Desktop application creates a Hello World template with nice icon bindings etc, but contains outdated plugins which refuse to update due to dependency issues on other plugins. Also an outdated version of browser platform is installed. It also contains all the plugins which may not all be required.

This template is a nice started template with these issues fixed and just the basic cordova-plugin-whitelist plugin present.
