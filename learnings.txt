sometimes if it fails then remove android platform and install again.

sometimes have to do phonegap clean and then phonegap run android. this happened for the cordova-plugin-facebook4 .

Important: in facebookconnect.xml file inside cordova-plugin-facebook4 we need to add these keys manually to resources tag:
<string name="fb_app_id">123456789</string>
<string name="fb_app_name">TEST</string>

this shud have typically got added when we passed variables while running the plugin but does not take from config-xml.

see more details here : http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/facebook/

also if nothing works do to D:\MyData\startups\gameofhands\src\platforms\android\app\src\main\res\values and put facebookconnect.xml there with the two keys .
copy this file from plugin directory of cordova-plugin-facebook4

see this too : https://github.com/jeduan/cordova-plugin-facebook4/issues/599 for the fb_app_id and db_app_name not getting copied over. chris has a solution to do this without
modifying any platform files.

- if you want to change app id and app name uninstall and reinstall the plugin.

- when we run cordova-facebook4 plugin , the tag added inside fb-root is not proper, tht is it does not wait for the fb js sdk to load and goes on to load a nonexistent
fbsdk.js and puts it in dom. luckily the previously adding script tag for the online version of sdk loads and FB is set on the window object.

---------------------\to get android key hash-----------

This is how i solved this problem

Download your APK to your PC in java jdk\bin folder

in my case C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_121\bin

go to java jdk\bin folder and run cmd then
copy the following command in your cmd

keytool -list -printcert -jarfile app-debug.apk

Copy the SHA1 value to your clip board
like this CD:A1:EA:A3:5C:5C:68:FB:FA:0A:6B:E5:5A:72:64:DD:26:8D:44:84
and open http://tomeko.net/online_tools/hex_to_base64.php to convert your SHA1 value to base64.
This is what Facebook requires
get the generated hash " ********************= " and copy the key hash to the facebook app.

-------------------------------------------------

generate signing keys :
keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore "C:\Users\Soham\.android\debug.keystore" | "D:\MyData\ssl\openssl-0.9.8e_X64\bin\openssl" sha1 -binary | "D:\MyData\ssl\openssl-0.9.8e_X64\bin\openssl" base64

This is the default keystore for debug mode set by android build tools:

Keystore name: "debug.keystore"
Keystore password: "android"
Key alias: "androiddebugkey"
Key password: "android"
CN: "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"

so android is the password for debug.keystore file. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18589694/i-have-never-set-any-passwords-to-my-keystore-and-alias-so-how-are-they-created


- if sometime cordova says launch success and app doesnt show up on phone then just reinstall the platform and add those 2 keys to facebook connect file and then run phonegap build android --verbose and then phonegap run android --verbose and it wrks.


-------------------------------------------------

always run from windows command line as the echo command in one of the hooks requires cmd not git-bash.
